  <h1>Hey There!</h1>

  <h2> Here's a Little About Me</h2>
  <p>Hey everyone, I'm Kevin and I'm a US Navy Veteran seeking to transition into a career in Data Science.</p>
  <p>LinkedIn Linkup: 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevincarrillo3/">LinkedIn</a>
  <p> I'm from a small in Northern California called Grass Valley where I had a very active life. If I wasn't playing basketball, I was skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeboarding or getting hurt. I also spent a lot of time playing guitar and still do to this day. I've been on a folk kick lately playing a lot of Noah Kahn, The Lumineers and bands like them.</p>
  <p>My interest in data science began in a business management systems course during my undergrad at SDSU. We gained experience in Power BI, Tableau, R and created a webpage just like this one. I have been hooked since and decided to move on to a MS in Data Science after I completed my BA in Economics. My Master's program is where I gained a strong foundation in statistics, machine learning (deep learning as well) in Python/R/SAS and enough HTML to create a user interface in order to deploy models.</p>
  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>When I'm not at my desk updating this living portfolio or working, I'm either playing a game of basketball in the local rec league, playing disc golf, or spending time with my friends and loved ones. My favorite game is any of the <em>Assassin's Creeds</em> and I'm a big <em>Warriors</em> fan.
